# Multer Doco On This Project:

In this project- on the server project i've been implemented the multer library as
a file uploading handle library.

# The next files are including the multer:

uploads (store the uploaded images)
middleware- upload.js (for the actual multer logic- destination and restrictions)
routes- product.js (for the route that include the multer middleware)
controllers- product.js (the logic to upload the multer image name stored in the uploads to MongoDB)
